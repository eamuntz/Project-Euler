This is a repo of Project Euler Solutions sans explanations. Unfortunately, some of my solutions are spread across devices and I only possess answers up to around question 70 at this time. In addition, this is my first time using Git so this repo also represents learning in that regard.

These are by no means optimized answers. Those that especially lack elegance will likely have additional notes about future improvement possibilities.
